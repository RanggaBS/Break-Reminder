# Break-Reminder
Shows a scrolling warning message after extended playtime.  This mod adds a moving marquee message on-screen when the player exceeds a set playtime, serving as a playful yet functional reminder to step away for a while.  Customize scroll speed, text direction (RTL: default, or LTR), and warning messages via config file.
